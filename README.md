# A Hybrid Approach for Online Novel Recommendation
Book recommendation systems focus on helping
users discover new books based on their previous preferences.
However, on novel reading platforms such as Wattpad, where
a user finds and reads novels directly on the websites, the
interactions between the user and the platform become more
complex. The user interactions are not only whether the users
choose to find a book and leave a review, a novel reading
platform can also keep track of a userâ€™s consumption of a specific
novel. A user on such a platform usually consumes the novel
in multiple sessions. Subsequently, a recommendation system
on such a reading platform should be able to recommend the
novels that are consumed by users as well as new novels at the
same time. Previous work, such as NovelNet, shows that,
by capturing these behaviors for each user session in a novel
reading platform, the authors are able to improve the quality of
their recommendation system. However, such recommendation
systems might overlook the fact that multiple users can have
similar sessions, and Sequence and Time Aware Neighborhood
(STAN) [2] recommendation system shows that matching user
sessions also produce high-quality recommendations. In our
paper, we propose a hybrid model that captures the best of
both worlds. Specifically, for each user session, we obtain the
ranked recommendations from both NovelNet and STAN, or
NovelNet and Association Rule (AR), We use a weighted sum
to calculate the final rankings for the recommendations. We
experiment with different sets of weights to determine the best
weights, and we demonstrate that, in the best case, the hybrid
model (NovelNet and STAN) provides users with more accurate
and relevant recommendations.

# Dataset
Datasets can be downloaded from: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ur9amfhf9mag213/AAAtI7SWJft1WZZiR03nyDNCa?dl=0.  
Unzip the dataset file to the data folder, `./data/`

# Run Hybrid Model
STEP 1:
- Run NovelNet model to get recommendation lists and scores:   
&ensp;`python run_confg_NN.py conf/in_for_fiction_rec_more/84_NN.yml`
- The recommendation lists and scores are saved in .tien file
- For example: "C:\Users\tttie\OneDrive\Desktop\CS 274\NovelNet-main\rar_base_dir\84s-batch_size=1024-epochs=1-embedding_size=128-hidden_size=128-attribute_embedding_size=32-top=1-debug=False-model_version=v4-dot_product=True\result\\**0.tien**"  
Note: the epoch is now set to 1. You can increase it in 84_NN.yml. The results will be different. After running NovelNet model, by looking at the output you will know which epoch give the best score. Then we will have different .tien files such as 1.tien, 2.tien and 3.tien. Select the .tien file that have the best score for the hybrid model in STEP 3.  
  
STEP 2:
- Run STAN model to get recommendation lists and scores:  
&ensp;`python run_confg_stan.py conf/in_for_fiction_rec_more/84_Stan.yml`
- The recommendation lists and scores are saved in .csv file
- For example: 'C:\Users\tttie\OneDrive\Desktop\CS 274\NovelNet-main\rar_base_dir\stan-k=3000-sample_size=10000-lambda_spw=0.905-lambda_snh=100-lambda_inh=0.6/**stan_06.csv**'
  
STEP 3:
- Open 'hybrid_stant06_NN.ipynb'
- After loading libraries, change file paths to location (the two files in Step 1 and 2) they are saved
- Go to Experiment section, change the file path in save_weighted_score() function  
  
 OPTION: Run AR
To run AR, open `run_confg_ar.py`, and go to line 569 to change the file path. Then run `python run_confg_ar.py conf/in_for_fiction_rec_more/84_AR.yml`. The recommendation lists and scores are saved in .csv file. For example, 'C:/Users/tttie/OneDrive/Desktop/CS 274/NovelNet-main/rar_base_dir/ar/ar.csv'  
To run the hybrid mode (NN+AR), do the same as STEP 3 with 'hybrid_AR_NN.ipynb'
